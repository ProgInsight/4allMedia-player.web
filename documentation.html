                <h2>📌</h2>
                <h2>Add Folder for Scanning</h2>
                <div class="feature-detail">
                    <p>By default, 4allMedia Player automatically scans for media files in your Music and Videos folders only.</p>
                    <p>You can add custom folders to allow 4allMedia Player to scan and index additional locations for quick access.</p>

                    <h3>How to Add a Folder</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the "Folders" filter in the Welcome screen</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The left panel will open automatically. Look for the "+" (Add) button and click it</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> A file browser dialog will open</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Navigate to the folder containing your media files</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click "Select" or "Add Folder" to confirm</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The player will begin scanning for media files automatically</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Scanning Process</h3>
                    <p>Once you add a folder, the player will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recursively scan all subfolders for supported media files</li>
                        <li>Index file metadata (title, artist, duration, album, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Display progress in the status bar</li>
                        <li>Add discovered media to your library automatically</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can add multiple folders—they will all be scanned and indexed</li>
                        <li>Add your largest media storage folders to maximize your library</li>
                        <li>The scanning process runs in the background and won't interrupt playback</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How to Create a New Playlist</h3>

                        <li><strong style="color: red;">TROUBLESHOOT:</strong> Once the playlist is created, it may show no content. Consider refreshing by switching to another filter (e.g., MV) and then back to the Playlist filter.</li>

                    <h3>Adding Content to Your New Playlist</h3>

                <h2>Delete Playlist</h2>
                <div class="feature-detail">
                    <p>Remove playlists you no longer need. Deleting a playlist removes only the collection—your original media files remain safe in your library.</p>

                    <h3>How to Delete a Playlist Entirely</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Method 1 - Context Menu:</strong> Right-click the playlist name in the sidebar and select "Delete Playlist"</li>
                        <li><strong>Method 2 - Delete Database:</strong> For Windows, the database is located at <code>"C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming\Player\Playlist.db"</code> For Debian within <code>"~/.player/playlist.db"</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Deletion Confirmation</h3>
                    <p>A confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm the deletion. This safeguard prevents accidental removal of your playlists. Click "Confirm" to proceed or "Cancel" to keep the playlist.</p>

                    <h3>What Happens After Deletion</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The playlist is permanently removed from your library</li>
                        <li>All media files that were in the playlist remain in your library</li>
                        <li>Deletion cannot be undone</li>
                        <li>To recover a deleted playlist, you must recreate it manually and re-add the content</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Alternative: Clear Playlist Contents</h3>
                    <p>If you want to keep the playlist but remove all its contents, you can do so without deleting the playlist itself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Double-click the playlist to expand it and view its contents</li>
                        <li>Hover over an individual track</li>
                        <li>Right-click and choose "Remove from Playlist"</li>
                        <li>The playlist remains in your sidebar, empty and ready for new content</li>
                        <li>Bulk removal of individual playlist files is not currently supported</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Important Notes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clearing a playlist's contents is useful when you want to repurpose it for different media</li>
                        <li>Deleted playlists cannot be recovered through the application</li>
                        <li>Consider exporting important playlists before deletion as a backup</li>
                        <li>Exporting and importing playlists from the GUI is not currently supported</li>
                    </ul>
